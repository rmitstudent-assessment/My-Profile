<h1>Project Idea</h1>
             </header>
  
<p>iwore is a social media application designed to bring fashionistas of the world together. Explore fashion through the inspiration of others by sharing your outfit details. Create closed groups to share with friends before an upcoming social event, or post publicly to share your looks with the iwore community. Upload photographs and details of your outfits, including clothes, jewellery, makeup and hairstyle. Furthermore, check-in at a location, enabling future users to research a venue before attending to ensure their outfit is on point. Following the application's success could extend to a get ready with me feature that lets budding beauticians present tutorials of how their looks came alive.</p>

<p>The motivation behind iwore will be to promote a positive environment in which women and men alike can share their fashion and remove the stresses of getting ready. Questions like "what do I wear to this venue/event?" or "what are they wearing, I want to buy it?" can all be answered using the application. Additionally, iwore aims to promote small businesses by tailoring content seen by a user based on location, giving the small business industry more visibility. Further questions like "what size do I buy?" can be answered by filtering your wall based on the size that you are. This filtering option provides a more realistic way of shopping instead of comparing yourself to a size six model with a perfectly edited photograph. The idea is to align iwore with natural beauty over staged beauty removing mental health issues associated with other social media platforms.</p> 
 
 <p>The content of iwore is user-generated, allowing a safe place for users to explore the fashion. The site layout will include a front page of tiles displaying the images uploaded by users. Clicking on a tile will allow the user to see the full post and read all the details. Posts will be of a blog like nature where details like size, store brought and so on are displayed.  Users can filter the home page to location area (so they can be exposed to boutique shops near them) or a specific venue (to research dress code) and size (to provide realistic images). 
A second wall will include all of the users unique content. Users will be able to style their homepage including, layout, background colour and font. The personalisation of a users homepages is to prepare for future application developments that include businesses. iwore allows each user/business to develop their specific online page that matches their style.
Users can also create closed groups only seen by their approved friend's list. Here the group can share ideas for what they are wearing to an upcoming function such as a wedding or formal. This function ensures that no one will arrive in the same outfit or either be over/underdressed again. iwore seeks to provide a positive browsing experience amongst its users and will not have the historical "like" function. Removal of the "like" part allows users to freely express themselves without worrying how many others agree or like their idea. Additionally, there will be no private messaging function to the application. As iwore is about collaboration and a healthy user experience, private messaging will not enhance that. This will also help monitor user comments ensuring they align with the iwore code of conduct policy.
Future iterations of the application will include a third wall of tiles from professionals in the beauty industry. Here, small businesses can showcase their services to the iwore community. This feature is vital in promoting small businesses as the wall will be based on location showing those closest to the user first. The content delivered from the beauticians will be of a "get ready with me" theme where they can showcase looks they have created and help others to make them themselves.</p>
 
<p>The iwore application will be deemed successful if it becomes a household name alongside the big social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram and TikTok. The metric for monitoring the success can be achieved by downloads from the application store and the number of users.</p>
