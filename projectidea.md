<p>iwore is a social media application designed to bring fashionistas of the world together. Explore fashion through the inspiration of others by sharing your outfit details. Create closed groups to share with friends before an upcoming social event, or post publicly to share your looks with the iwore community. Upload photographs and details of your outfits, including clothes, jewellery, makeup and hairstyle. Furthermore, check-in at a location, enabling future users to research a venue before attending to ensure their outfit is on point. Following the application's success could extend to a get ready with me feature that lets budding beauticians present tutorials of how their looks came alive.</p>
