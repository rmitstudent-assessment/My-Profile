 <h3>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</h3>
<p>The three tests conducted in this paper each hold their unique value. The first assessment I took was the Myers-Briggs assessment, in which I was able to identify a lot of my characteristics in the assessment results. This quiz highlighted my personality strengths and almost solidified who I am in writing. However, this assessment lacked understanding of how best I can apply myself in a team environment. The second test I took focused on learning styles. My results indicated that I was an auditory closely followed by a tactile learner. I thought about these results the most out of all the quizzes as I don't think I am an auditory learner; I would be more inclined to believe I am tactile. As a positive, this got me exploring different concepts and methods for the two learning styles. I have found a few techniques that work for me from that research. The final test that I took was the Big Five Personality Assessment. This assessment was similar to that of the Myers-Briggs quiz. The results of this test gave me another perspective of myself. Previously in my work life, I have taken a number of these quizzes, and I have learned more about myself each time. Knowing who you are and how you work can identify the areas you can improve. It is an essential skill to work on yourself constantly, and these tests are a good starting point on that journey.</p>

 <h3>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h3>
 <p>The three tests will help me become more aware of my personality positives and negatives. When working in a team, I can use the positives of my personality to help our team. For example, my positives are good leadership and organisation. These are things I could use to take the lead in the team environment. However, the negatives of my personality become things that I need to be aware of when working in a team. I know that I need to be more patient with my team and let them work through a problem without interjecting the solution.</p>

 <h3>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h3>
<p>In the initial phase of creating a team, say when hiring a new team member, personality tests could be used to enhance the performance and outcomes of the group. Individual personality traits that work well together are assigned with each other removing the possibility of team conflict. However, it is not always possible to develop groups in this manner. In these situations, there is value in sharing the results of the tests with one another. This allows members to understand the different communication styles and the best way to collaborate effectively. I have done personality workshops at work and learned how best to approach certain members or motivate others and found this to be a vital skill throughout my career.</p>
