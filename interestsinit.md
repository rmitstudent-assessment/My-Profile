<h1>Interests in IT</h1>
             </header>


<h3>What is you interest in IT? When did your interest start?</h3>
<p>My interest in IT started during my career within the Australian Defence Force. I was initially employed as a radio operator, where my trade was operating analogue radios. During this period, the technology of the in-service radio transitioned from analogue to digital. To stay relevant in my profession, I quickly started developing my IT theoretical and practical skills. My skills deepened at the height of my ADF career as I began building and managing ad-hoc networks, primarily Linux based, and providing basic cyber advice in fields like signature reduction. Furthermore, I was responsible for the overall system and equipment governance and training in areas where I was deemed a subject matter expert. Leaving the ADF raised many questions about what was next, and I found myself drawn to continuing on the path of IT. I am now happily employed as an SFIA level 3, IT administrator. Years of on-the-job training to develop solutions to complex problems have evolved a specific passion of mine, anonymity in a modern world where everything is moving online. For example, my home cameras run on a Raspberry Pi to control where the data is sent, removing the need for a third party to store my data. </p>

<h3>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.</h3>
<p>My career within the Australian Defence Force sparked an inherent interest in IT. However, my drive to explore IT further is a credit to some of my colleagues throughout that period. A select few individuals, in particular, acted as mentors to me, the majority of which were employed as information technology specialists and were conducting higher studies within the same field. Through them, I was able to work with them on projects and have someone to guide me through my studies when I was unsure of anything. Throughout my career, I have obtained a sound baseline of knowledge in IT. Namely, I have experience working on Linux systems such as Ubuntu and CentOS. Furthermore, I have a baseline knowledge of configuring Cisco devices such as switches and routers. I also have exposure to applications AWS, VMware and vCentre.</p>
<p>I chose to undertake this unit as an elective towards my Bachelors of Security Studies through Open Universities Australia. My Bachelor's subject matter is an area I am passionate about and interested in. However, I wanted to tailor my elective subjects towards my area of employment; my goal is to round my experience into more formalised training. Introduction to Information and Technology's content ensures undertaking this unit is a step in achieving my goal. Additionally, the exposure to industry terminology, jobs roles, and career paths is something I am interested in learning throughout this unit.</p>

<h3>Why did you chose to come to RMIT?</h3>
<p>I chose to undertake this unit as an elective towards my Bachelors of Security Studies through Open Universities Australia. My Bachelor's subject matter is an area I am passionate about and interested in.

Additionally, the exposure to industry terminology, jobs roles, and career paths is something I am interested in learning throughout this unit.</p>

<h3>What do you expect to learn in your studies?</h3>
<p>Throughout this course, I hope to learn more about the overall aspects of IT. It is the modules that cover industry terminology, career paths and understanding the different fields within IT that are of most importance to me. Furthermore, I hope that this course will help me baseline some of my informal Army training and round it off with industry best practices, terms and cement my skills and knowledge.</p>
