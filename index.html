     <h1>Interests in IT</h1>
  <p><h4>What is you interest in IT? When did your interest start?</h4></p>
<p>My interest in IT started throughout my career within the Australian Defence Force. I was initially employed as a radio operator, whereby my trade was operating analogue radios. During this period, the technology of the in-service radio transitioned from analogue to digital. To stay relevant in my profession, I quickly started growing my fundamental IT theoretical knowledge and practical skills. My skills deepened at the height of my ADF career as I began building and managing ad-hoc networks, primarily Linux based, and providing basic cyber advice in fields like signature reduction. Furthermore, I was responsible for the overall system and equipment governance and training in areas where I was deemed a subject matter expert. Leaving the ADF raised many questions about what was next, and I found myself drawn to continuing on the path of IT. I am now happily employed as an SFIA level 3, IT administrator.
Years of on-the-job training to develop solutions to complex problems have evolved a specific passion of mine, anonymity in a modern world where everything is moving online. For example, my home cameras run on a Raspberry Pi to control where the data is sent, removing the need for a third party to store my data.
  <p><h4>Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience.</h4></p>
My career within the Australian Defence Force sparked an inherent interest in IT. However, my drive to explore IT further is a credit to some of my colleagues throughout that period.  A select few individuals, in particular, acted as mentors to me, the majority of which were employed as information technology specialists and were conducting higher studies within the same field. Through them, I was able to work with them on projects and have someone to guide me through my studies when I was unsure of anything.
Throughout my career, I have obtained a sound baseline of knowledge in IT. Namely, I have experience working on Linux systems such as Ubuntu and CentOS. Furthermore, I have a baseline knowledge of configuring Cisco devices such as switches and routers. I also have exposure to applications AWS, VMware and vCentre.</p>
  <p><h4>Why did you chose to come to RMIT?</h4></p>
<p>I chose to undertake this unit as an elective towards my Bachelors of Security Studies through Open Universities Australia. My Bachelor's subject matter is an area I am passionate about and interested in. However, I wanted to tailor my elective subjects towards my area of employment; my goal is to round my experience into more formalised training. Introduction to Information and Technology's content ensures undertaking this unit is a step in achieving my goal. Additionally, the exposure to industry terminology, jobs roles, and career paths is something I am interested in learning throughout this unit.</p>
  <p><h4>What do you expect to learn in your studies?</h4></p>

<p>Throughout this course, I hope to learn more about the overall aspects of IT. It is the modules that cover industry terminology, career paths and understanding the different fields within IT that are of most importance to me. Furthermore, I hope that this course will help me baseline some of my informal Army training and round it off with industry best practices, terms and cement my skills and knowledge.</p>

    <h1>Ideal Job</h1>

  <p><h4>Job Advertisement</h4></p>

<p>Click on the link for my ideal job: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/55255356?type=standout#searchRequestToken=42ef42ab-cfbf-418d-83d4-85f68e0a6b20">Service Delivery Manger Commonwealth Bank Australia</a> </p>

  <p><h4>Description of the position, particularly why it appeals to you</h4></p>

<p>The job that I chose is for a position working within Commonwealth Bank as a service delivery manager (SDM). This job role particularly appeals to me as a goal to reach within the lifetime of my career for three reasons:</p>
<p>1.	The job maintains strong linkages to IT, which is essential in keeping my technical knowledge and skillset relevant.<br>
2.	The position is managerial and, as such, compliments my natural leadership characteristics.<br>
3.	Working for a large organisation, such as one of the big five banks of Australia, has several benefits; most important to me is exposure gained from working for an institute that is heavily reliant on quick and secure information systems practices.</p>
<p>The role of the service delivery manager is a leadership position focusing heavily on liaisons between departments. Internally, the SDM is responsible for the HR of their team and providing overall governance to empower them to complete tasks. Additionally, the role focuses on managing relationships between their team, Public Cloud Foundational Services, and the Tenant Application team. This ensures all services are maintained and administered quickly and efficiently through appropriate change management processes. The SDM is also required to foresee and manage the rollout of any future projects of interest to their team.</p>

  <p><h4>Description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</h4><p>

<p>The service delivery manager advertisement helps provide the applicants with enough detail about the qualifications required for the job. As the position is within the cloud services division, experience with AWS and Azure are preferred. Additionally, ITIL training; through the managing professional stream to understand change management and agile work practices. The SDM position also highlights a requirement for previous experience to demonstrate professionalism, change management processes, and liaise with the customer.</p>

  <p><h4>Description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</h4></p>

<p>The ADF informally gave a number of the skills and qualifications within IT; however, none of which can formally be recognised in civilian organisations. Although, through my current employer, I have acquired a certificate in ITIL Foundations 4 and vendor training for SharePoint, Splunk, and ManageEngine (ITSM).
A core part of my current work is understanding the change management process and working closely with the SDM in refining these business practices. Additionally, I am currently the understudy of one of the senior system administrators who is building on my understanding and management of enterprise networks. This focuses on SCCM, Public Key Infrastructure, Active Directory, intrusion detection and response and networking.</p>

  <p><h4>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those that you have now</h4></p>
<p>To achieve my dream goal as an SDM for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, I can do several things now to ensure this is possible in the future. Firstly, I can continue my ITIL training and complete the courses required to meet the ITIL managing professional stream. Obtaining this will provide me with the knowledge, skills and certificates to become competitive when applying for an SDM role. Secondly, I will need exposure or experience in fulfilling the roles of an SDM. My employer is aware of my goal and has empowered me to work closely with my SDM in a mentorship capacity. However, if I can't transition to an SDM within my team in the future, it would be beneficial to leave and apply for a junior SDM role within another organisation. Finally, continuing learning and taking opportunities to go on courses is vital to enhancing my IT knowledge and skills.</p>

    <h1>Personal Profile</h1>

  <h4>Results of an online Myers-Briggs test</h4>
  <h4>Results of an online learning styles test</h4>
  <h4>Results of an online The Big Five Personality Test test</h4>
  <h4>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</h4>
<p>The three tests conducted in this paper each hold their unique value. The first assessment I took was the Myers-Briggs assessment, in which I was able to identify a lot of my characteristics in the assessment results. This quiz highlighted my personality strengths and almost solidified who I am in writing. However, this assessment lacked understanding of how best I can apply myself in a team environment.
The second test I took focused on learning styles. My results indicated that I was an auditory closely followed by a tactile learner. I thought about these results the most out of all the quizzes as I don't think I am an auditory learner; I would be more inclined to believe I am tactile. As a positive, this got me exploring different concepts and methods for the two learning styles. I have found a few techniques that work for me from that research.
The final test that I took was the Big Five Personality Assessment. This assessment was similar to that of the Myers-Briggs quiz. The results of this test gave me another perspective of myself.
Previously in my work life, I have taken a number of these quizzes, and I have learned more about myself each time. Knowing who you are and how you work can identify the areas you can improve. It is an essential skill to work on yourself constantly, and these tests are a good starting point on that journey.</p>

  <h4>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</h4>

<p>Insert something here</p>
  <h4>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</h4>

<p>There is a large value in reading about the other results you can get aside from knowing about you. This can help you apply things to others that don’t understand.</p>

    <h1>Project Idea</h1>

<p>iwore is a social media application designed to bring fashionistas of the world together. Explore fashion through the inspiration of others by sharing your outfit's intimate details, including; cost, size, jewellery, makeup and the store from which the user brought all of the items. This app removes the stresses of getting ready and answering questions like what is appropriate to wear at that venue/event and what they are wearing. Users can connect by tagging into locations and updating images of their outfits with the attached metadata. In turn, this information becomes searchable to other users looking into that venue. Additionally, users can upload the same data to a closed event. Here, users can show the outfits they plan to wear to an upcoming social outing with friends, such as a wedding. Following the application's success, this could extend to a get ready with me feature that lets budding makeup artists and hairstylists present tutorials of how their styles came alive.
<br>
The motivation behind iwore will be to promote a positive environment in which women and men alike can share their fashion and remove the stresses of getting ready. This application aims in promoting smaller businesses by pushing data tailored around the user's location, heightening the visibility of an otherwise smothered industry. iwore will be proud supporters of body confidence removing the high quality, edited model shots we are so often exposed to and replacing them with the real you.
