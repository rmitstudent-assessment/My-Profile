<h3>Job Advertisement</h3>
<p>Click on the link for my ideal job: <a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/55255356?type=standout#searchRequestToken=42ef42ab-cfbf-418d-83d4-85f68e0a6b20">Service Delivery Manger Commonwealth Bank Australia</a> </p>

<h3>Description of the position, particularly why it appeals to you</h3>
<p>The job that I chose is for a position working within Commonwealth Bank as a service delivery manager (SDM). This job role particularly appeals to me as a goal to reach within the lifetime of my career for three reasons:

1. The job maintains strong linkages to IT, which is essential in keeping my technical knowledge and skillset relevant.
2. The position is managerial and, as such, compliments my natural leadership characteristics.
3. Working for a large organisation, such as one of the big five banks of Australia, has several benefits; most important to me is exposure gained from working for an institute that is heavily reliant on quick and secure information systems practices.

The role of the service delivery manager is a leadership position focusing heavily on liaisons between departments. Internally, the SDM is responsible for the HR of their team and providing overall governance to empower them to complete tasks. Additionally, the role focuses on managing relationships between their team, Public Cloud Foundational Services, and the Tenant Application team. This ensures all services are maintained and administered quickly and efficiently through appropriate change management processes. The SDM is also required to foresee and manage the rollout of any future projects of interest to their team.</p>

<h3>Description of the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position</h3>
<p>The service delivery manager advertisement helps provide the applicants with enough detail about the qualifications required for the job. As the position is within the cloud services division, experience with AWS and Azure are preferred. Additionally, ITIL training; through the managing professional stream to understand change management and agile work practices. The SDM position also highlights a requirement for previous experience to demonstrate professionalism, change management processes, and liaise with the customer.</p>

<h3>Description of the skills, qualifications and experience you currently have</h3>
<p>The ADF informally gave a number of the skills and qualifications within IT; however, none of which can formally be recognised in civilian organisations. Although, through my current employer, I have acquired a certificate in ITIL Foundations 4 and vendor training for SharePoint, Splunk, and ManageEngine (ITSM). A core part of my current work is understanding the change management process and working closely with the SDM in refining these business practices. Additionally, I am currently the understudy of one of the senior system administrators who is building on my understanding and management of enterprise networks. This focuses on SCCM, Public Key Infrastructure, Active Directory, intrusion detection and response and networking.</p>

<h3>A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications and experience required for the position, building on those that you have now</h3>
<p>To achieve my dream goal as an SDM for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, I can do several things now to ensure this is possible in the future. Firstly, I can continue my ITIL training and complete the courses required to meet the ITIL managing professional stream. Obtaining this will provide me with the knowledge, skills and certificates to become competitive when applying for an SDM role. Secondly, I will need exposure or experience in fulfilling the roles of an SDM. My employer is aware of my goal and has empowered me to work closely with my SDM in a mentorship capacity. However, if I can't transition to an SDM within my team in the future, it would be beneficial to leave and apply for a junior SDM role within another organisation. Finally, continuing learning and taking opportunities to go on courses is vital to enhancing my IT knowledge and skills.</p>
